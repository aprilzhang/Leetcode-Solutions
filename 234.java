/**
234. Palindrome Linked List
Given a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.

Follow up:
Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?
*/
//NOTE: THIS QUESTION CANNOT DONE WITH O(1) SPACE!
/**
This can be solved by reversing the 2nd half and compare the two halves. Let's start with an example [1, 1, 2, 1].

In the beginning, set two pointers fast and slow starting at the head.

1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> null 
sf
(1) Move: fast pointer goes to the end, and slow goes to the middle.

1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> null 
          s          f
(2) Reverse: the right half is reversed, and slow pointer becomes the 2nd head.

1 -> 1    null <- 2 <- 1           
h                      s
(3) Compare: run the two pointers head and slow together and compare.

1 -> 1    null <- 2 <- 1             
     h            s
